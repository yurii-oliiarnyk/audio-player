## Getting started
- Clone the project
- Run `npm install` inside the folder
- Run `npm run start` to start the development server
- Open the URL `http:\\localhost:8080`
- App is now running, so get to developing awesome stuff!

## Building production app
You simply run `npm run build:prod`

After it's done, four new files with be in the `dist/` folder.

Upload the `index.html` and the `dist/` folder to your server, and your good to go!

**How it should look on your server**
```
- dist/
    - main.css
    - main.css.map
    - bundle.js
    - bundle.js.map
index.html
```

NOTE: Please remember to route all URL's on your server to the `index.html` file, for best experience.

## Redux store persistence
Currently the template is setup to put the whole Redux store into `localStorage`, but you could easily expand it to only store the stuff you want persistent.
